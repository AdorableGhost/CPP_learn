# 2019 Year-End Review

- Elliot Zhuang
  
## Summary

### What I did in the year

### work path

- At the very first,I am in *** Hotel as  a employee who do every stuff about computer.then I left.

- At the middle of this year ,got in another hotel ,as a Deputy General Manager...but I am not good at it and I can't do it ï¼Œthe reason why I was there is that I was introduced by my friend,and they thought that I can grow ,but ,I am not really in such at such a thing like management or as a manager .So I left after three months . Then ,I thought that I should pick my dream back ,doing somehthing about computer programming .

- Then ,I went and search jobs about programming ,then ,got in the company now I am in .As a front developper of website (I was cheated,front website development is programming ?but maybe I can only do this well at that time)
  
### Learning Stuff

- Reviewed PHP .
- learnt javascript.
- learnt Laravel but really not in it 
- the most important : I learnt most CPP this year untill now 2020 I am still in it and I will continue (that do be what called programming )
  
### Emotion path

- hurt by my mom .she left me alone after my dad  have been dead previous year
  
- be a single dog still (maybe will be forever)
  

## Details

- not happy to tell maybe .
  
## Feeling of the year 

most likely , I was in a crossroad,and I have to make a very important choice this year,so I did . I choosed to be a programmer ,and I abandoned all the things I own before.Actually ,I own nothing maybe ,and the family had separated  without reason , I have nothing to rely on ,both in emothion and real life ,that always  is like that but I haven't realised , I was so lonely in all this year ,but I have no one to tell . your closest family can't leave you because of money , what you regard as treasures may value nothing there in other's heart .and I can feel it ,so ,maybe time to change ,what dropped you must be dropped ! no mercy  to those who  without  love ,they are animal ,why should you regard them humanbeings?
